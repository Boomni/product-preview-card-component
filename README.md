## Overview
The product preview card component is a responsive card that shows the details of a product. It has a main image, product information, and a section to highlight the product's features. The challenge is to build this card and make it responsive, so that it looks good on different devices, and to add hover and focus states for interactive elements.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
